# Multiclass stress_prediction

- The main objective of this assignment is to use machine leanring techniques to predict stress. 
- Psychological stress is defined as “a particular relationship between the person and the environment that is appraised by the person as taxing or exceeding his or her resources and endangering his or her well-being”.(Lazarus Folkman, 1984) 
- There are 3 levels of stress - relaxed, neutral and stressed, they correspond with 0, 1 and 2 in the dataset.
- The data comes from this paper :  https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/9067
(Wearable measurements of various young people driving in stressing environments, e.g. rush hour, highways,
red lights, as well as a relaxation period are used. The objective is to use readings from a Microsoft Band 2 smart watch to predict the stress levels
of the user)
